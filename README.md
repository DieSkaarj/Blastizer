Mega Drive / Genesis Image Converter

It is half two in the morning, as I write this. The code is a fucking mess. It started out as another iteration of the BlastEd tilemap editor. A way to import images as a tileset. But, diverged because, why not? 

Basically, what it does is this. It quantizes the original image into sixteen (16) colours and then maps them to the Mega Drive/Genesis colour palette. There might be a better way to order this. There are some post-processing options available for more complex images.

Any big bugs, at the moment, contact the UCF Military because I-- I am off to my pit. Questions, issues and etc: usual haunts.
